# LibreTower-Assets

<p>Welcome to the LibreTower Assets repository. Here, the files for things like LMMS and Aseprite projects, bfxr sounds, and the likes.</p>

**If you're looking for the _source code_, click [here](https://github.com/Applemunch/LibreTower).**

### Notes

- Be sure to have the following files when opening LMMS projects:
  - [gzdoom.sf2](https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/blob/master/soundfont/gzdoom.sf2) for most projects
  - [GM.dls Remastered v2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/118TpIuJPrvNcNNIYs-kXb-jcwQYeSLEI?usp=sharing) and [Music Theory 2](https://www.rkhive.com/new/new_banks/mustheory2.zip) for Escape Theme
  - The most recent development version of LMMS. Although not likely required, soundfonts won't automatically load themselves if present when opening a project from a dev version of LMMS in a *release* version.
